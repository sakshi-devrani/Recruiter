# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GreatVibes-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/GreatVibes-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
    - family: JosefinSlab
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/JosefinSlab.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
    - family: HennyPenny
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/HennyPenny.ttf
